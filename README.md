This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## [Completed website](https://learn-next-js.netlify.app/)

This was a good practice for me because I learnt:

- What Next.js is and some fundamentals of how it can be used
- Got better understanding of React, because Next.js is based of it, and I had very small prerior knowladge of React before
- How to deploy a Next.js app from github repo to [Netlify](https://learn-next-js.netlify.app/)
