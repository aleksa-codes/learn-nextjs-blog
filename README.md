This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

## [Completed website](https://jovial-blackwell-59abd5.netlify.app)

This was a good practice for me because I learnt:

- What Next.js is and some how it can be used
- Got better understanding of React, because Next.js is based on it
- Learnt how to deploy a Next.js app from github repo to [Netlify](https://jovial-blackwell-59abd5.netlify.app)
